                Are you a Snoop Dog fan? Do you consider yourself more of a Whitesnake listener? Have you been dreaming of seeing Joe Satriani in a live concert? Or maybe you’re more into underground events, feeling more comfortable in small audience crowds. <br>
                Then you should definitely check out the place made for any of these kinds of concert goers. It’s called <strong>Train</strong> and it’s located in Aarhus. <br> <br>

            <p><strong>Why Train?</strong><br>
                After buying that vintage jacket (link), you must be looking for a cool concert where you can wear it. However, it seems that nowadays it’s harder than ever to find a good place to listen to some good ol’ live rock music. <br><br><br>

                <a href="http://www.train.dk/">Train</a> started in 1998 as a place where people of Aarhus can attend rock concerts. What started as a private initiative as a contribution to the local music scene has since grown into one of the most popular venues in the country.

                In 2000 Train was appointed as the Regional Venue and Cultural <br> Growth Center of Aarhus Municipality and the Danish Arts Council. <br>
                Train has been one of Denmark's largest concert venues, carrying a high quality and international class music profile. This is a place where you can see world names presented side by side with artists of a more narrow and niche character. <br>
