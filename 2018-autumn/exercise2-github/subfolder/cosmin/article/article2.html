                Buying clothes can either be fun or a big pain in the.. pocket.<br> So why not go the vintage-way? Especially when you get to enjoy the feeling of discovering the needle (aka “that cool jacket that fits you so well”) in the hay.

        <article class="summary">
            <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
                We totally get you – not everyone is comfortable with wearing stuff used by someone else in the first place. Most of us are also very picky when buying clothes because we want to be unique that way.<br>

                However, being unique does not have to mean buying new and expensive clothes.<br>

                <a href="http://hellovintage.dk/hello-vintage-2/">Hello Vintage</a> is an initiative whose purpose is to “take over all of Denmark with the vintage concept - and enrich you all with fashionable, unique and cheap clothes!” Basically, they are travelling all over Denmark, renting huge spaces for short periods of time and organizing large sells.<br>

                The concept is simple and straightforward: you go in the shopping hall, you dive into those 3 tons of vintage clothes and you pay for the exact weight of items you have chosen (yes, you pay per kilo, not per individual article).<br>

                    <strong>
                        Forget about expensive clothing </strong><br>

                    One important thing to remember is that you have to pay at the entrance no matter what. Hello Vintage says that having an entrance fee allows them to rent the market halls and sell selected vintage items at affordable prices.<br>

                    Speaking about prices:<br>
                    &#8226; The entrance fee is 40, - per person and kids under 12 years get free entrance. You can pay cash or by mobilepay. <br>
                    &#8226; Clothing costs 200, - per kilo (1 kilo = about 4-6 pieces of clothing).<br>
